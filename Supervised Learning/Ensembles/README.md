## Overview

This project demonstrates practical implementations of **ensemble learning techniques** for both regression and classification problems. It also establishes the theoretical foundation using **decision trees**, which serve as the base learners for most ensemble methods.

Ensemble learning improves **accuracy, robustness, and generalization** by combining multiple models, while decision trees provide the underlying structure for learning complex decision boundaries.

### Overview

Decision Trees are a **non-parametric supervised learning method** used for both classification and regression tasks. They model decision-making processes using a hierarchical tree structure.

Each internal node represents a feature-based condition, each branch represents an outcome, and each leaf node represents a final prediction.

---

### Learning Objectives

- Understand tree structure and recursive splitting  
- Learn impurity-based decision making  
- Analyze strengths and limitations  
- Build intuition for model tuning  

---

### Problem Formulation

Given input features X and target variable y, the objective is to learn a function:

f(X) → y  

The model partitions the feature space into regions and assigns predictions based on majority class (classification) or mean value (regression).

---

### How Decision Trees Work

- Select best feature and threshold  
- Split dataset into subsets  
- Recursively repeat splitting  
- Continue until stopping criteria are met  

Each root-to-leaf path represents a decision rule.

---

### Splitting Criteria

#### Classification

**Gini Impurity**  
Gini = 1 − Σ (pᵢ)²  

**Entropy**  
Entropy = − Σ pᵢ log₂(pᵢ)  

#### Regression

**Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  
MSE = (1/n) Σ (yᵢ − ŷᵢ)²  

---

### Algorithm Workflow

1. Start with full dataset  
2. Evaluate all splits  
3. Choose best split  
4. Partition data  
5. Repeat recursively  
6. Stop based on constraints  

---

### Model Complexity and Overfitting

Decision trees tend to overfit when deep.

#### Regularization Techniques

- Max depth  
- Minimum samples per split  
- Minimum samples per leaf  
- Pruning  

---

### Advantages

- Interpretable  
- Handles non-linearity  
- Minimal preprocessing  
- Works with mixed data types  

---

### Limitations

- Overfitting  
- Instability  
- Sensitive to noise  
- Biased toward dominant features  

---

## Ensemble Learning

### Key Concepts

- **Bagging** reduces variance  
- **Boosting** reduces bias  
- **Stacking** combines models using meta-learning  

---

## Why Ensemble Learning Builds on Trees

Decision Trees are high-variance models. Ensemble methods improve them by:

| Method   | Improvement Mechanism |
|----------|----------------------|
| Bagging  | Reduces variance     |
| Boosting | Reduces bias         |
| Stacking | Improves prediction  |
