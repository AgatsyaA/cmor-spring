## Overview

This module focuses on supervised learning, a core paradigm in machine learning where models are trained using labeled data. Each input is associated with a known output, enabling the model to learn a mapping function and generalize to unseen data.

Supervised learning relies on predefined outcomes to guide the training process, distinguishing it from unsupervised approaches where patterns are discovered without labels.

The objective of this section is to provide both conceptual clarity and practical implementation of widely used supervised learning algorithms, with an emphasis on understanding model behavior, assumptions, and performance trade-offs.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the mathematical and conceptual foundations of supervised learning  
- Implement core algorithms and analyze their behavior  
- Evaluate models using standard performance metrics  
- Build intuition for selecting appropriate models for different problem types

## Problem Formulation

Supervised learning aims to learn a function:

f(X) → y

Where:
- X represents input features  
- y represents the target variable  

The goal is to approximate this function such that predictions on unseen data minimize error under a chosen loss function.

## Types of Supervised Learning

### Classification
Predicts discrete labels.

Examples:
- Spam detection  
- Disease classification  
- Customer churn prediction  

### Regression
Predicts continuous values.

Examples:
- House price prediction  
- Demand forecasting  
- Risk scoring

## Algorithms Implemented

The following algorithms are implemented and organized in this module:

### Decision Tree
Tree-based model for classification and regression. Handles non-linear relationships and is highly interpretable.

### Ensembles
Combines multiple models to improve robustness and performance, reducing variance and improving generalization.

### Gradient Descent
Optimization algorithm used to minimize loss functions. Forms the backbone of many machine learning models.

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Instance-based learning method that classifies data points based on proximity in feature space.

### Linear Regression
Models linear relationships between features and target variables. Commonly used for prediction tasks.

### Logistic Regression
Probabilistic model for classification that outputs likelihood scores using a logistic function.

### Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
Feedforward neural network capable of capturing complex non-linear relationships.

### Neural Networks
General framework for deep learning models, enabling scalable representation learning.

### Perceptron
Basic linear classifier and foundational building block for neural networks.
