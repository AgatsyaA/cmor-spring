## Overview

Decision Trees are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for both classification and regression tasks. They represent decisions using a tree-like structure, where each internal node corresponds to a feature-based condition, each branch represents an outcome, and each leaf node represents a final prediction.

They are widely used due to their interpretability, ability to model non-linear relationships, and minimal preprocessing requirements.

A decision tree is fundamentally a flowchart-like model that evaluates decisions and their possible consequences, making it useful both in machine learning and business decision analysis. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## How Decision Trees Work

Decision Trees recursively partition the dataset by selecting features that best separate the data based on a target variable.

At each step:
- A feature is selected
- A threshold or rule is applied
- The dataset is split into subsets
- The process repeats until a stopping condition is met

Each path from root to leaf represents a decision rule.

## Splitting Criteria

### Classification

**Gini Impurity**  
Measures the probability of incorrect classification.

Gini = 1 − Σ (pᵢ)²

**Entropy**  
Measures randomness or disorder.

Entropy = − Σ pᵢ log₂(pᵢ)

The model selects splits that minimize impurity.

### Regression

**Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  
Measures variance within a node.

The objective is to minimize prediction error across splits.

## Algorithm Workflow

1. Start with the full dataset as the root node  
2. Evaluate all possible splits across features  
3. Select the split that maximizes information gain or minimizes error  
4. Partition the data into subsets  
5. Repeat recursively for each branch  
6. Stop when:
   - Maximum depth is reached  
   - Minimum samples per node is reached  
   - No further improvement is possible

## Practical Applications

Decision Trees are widely used in both machine learning and business decision-making contexts:

- Fraud detection  
- Medical diagnosis  
- Credit risk assessment  
- Customer segmentation  
- Recommendation systems  

In business planning, decision trees help evaluate multiple possible outcomes and guide strategic decisions such as market expansion, pricing changes, and investment analysis. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

They are especially useful when dealing with complex, multi-outcome scenarios where risks and trade-offs must be evaluated. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## Advantages

- Easy to interpret and visualize  
- Handles both numerical and categorical data  
- Requires minimal preprocessing  
- Captures non-linear relationships  
- Provides clear decision rules  

---

## Limitations

- Prone to overfitting  
- Sensitive to small changes in data  
- Can become complex with deep trees  
- May not generalize well without regularization  

---

## Improving Model Performance

- Pruning to reduce overfitting  
- Limiting tree depth  
- Setting minimum samples per split  
- Using ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)

## Key Takeaways

- Decision Trees are interpretable and effective baseline models  
- They decompose complex decisions into simple rules  
- Proper regularization is critical for performance  
- They form the foundation of advanced ensemble methods

## Conclusion

Decision Trees provide a powerful balance between interpretability and predictive capability. Their ability to model decisions explicitly makes them valuable not only in machine learning but also in real-world strategic decision-making scenarios.
