## Overview

**Gradient Descent** is an optimization algorithm used to **minimize a loss function** by iteratively adjusting model parameters in the direction of the **negative gradient**.

It is a foundational technique in machine learning and deep learning, enabling models to learn patterns by reducing prediction error over time.

---

## How It Works

- Initialize model parameters (weights)  
- Compute the gradient of the loss function  
- Update parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient  
- Repeat until convergence (minimum loss achieved)  

---

## Update Rule

<p align="center">
  <strong>θ = θ − α · ∇J(θ)</strong>
</p>

Where:

- θ → Model parameters  
- α → Learning rate  
- ∇J(θ) → Gradient of the loss function

## Types of Gradient Descent

- **Batch Gradient Descent** → Uses entire dataset for each update  
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** → Updates using one data point at a time  
- **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent** → Uses small subsets of data  

---

## Key Concepts

- **Learning Rate** → Step size for updates  
- **Cost Function** → Measure of error to minimize  
- **Convergence** → Point where updates stabilize  
- **Local Minimum** → Lowest point in a region (not always global)  

---

## Advantages

- Simple and widely applicable  
- Works well with large-scale models  
- Efficient for differentiable functions  

---

## Limitations

- Sensitive to learning rate selection  
- Can get stuck in local minima or saddle points  
- May converge slowly for complex functions  

---

## Common Enhancements

- **Momentum** → Accelerates convergence  
- **Adam Optimizer** → Adaptive learning rates  
- **RMSProp** → Handles varying gradients  
- **Learning Rate Scheduling** → Improves stability  

---

## Applications

- Linear and logistic regression  
- Neural networks and deep learning  
- Recommendation systems  
- Natural language processing
