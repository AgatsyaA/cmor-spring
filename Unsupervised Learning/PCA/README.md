## Overview

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving as much variance as possible.

It achieves this by projecting data onto a new set of orthogonal axes (principal components) that capture the maximum variance in descending order.

PCA is widely used for data compression, visualization, noise reduction, and as a preprocessing step for machine learning models.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of dimensionality reduction  
- Learn how PCA transforms data into principal components  
- Analyze variance explained by each component  
- Apply PCA for visualization and preprocessing  

---

## Problem Formulation

Given a dataset X with high dimensionality, PCA aims to find a transformation:

X → Z

Where:
- Z is a lower-dimensional representation of X  
- The variance retained in Z is maximized  

---

## Key Concepts

### Variance
Measures the spread of data. PCA maximizes variance along principal components.

### Principal Components
New orthogonal axes formed as linear combinations of original features.

### Orthogonality
Principal components are uncorrelated (independent of each other).

### Explained Variance
Indicates how much information each principal component retains.

## Mathematical Intuition

1. Standardize the dataset  
2. Compute covariance matrix  
3. Perform eigenvalue decomposition  
4. Sort eigenvectors by eigenvalues (descending order)  
5. Select top K eigenvectors  
6. Project data onto selected components  

---

## Algorithm Workflow

1. Normalize or standardize data  
2. Compute covariance matrix  
3. Calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors  
4. Sort components by importance (variance explained)  
5. Select top K components  
6. Transform data into reduced dimension

## Choosing Number of Components

### Explained Variance Ratio
Select components that capture a desired percentage of variance (e.g., 90–95%).

### Scree Plot
Plot eigenvalues vs component number to identify diminishing returns.

## Advantages

- Reduces dimensionality effectively  
- Improves computational efficiency  
- Removes noise and redundancy  
- Helps in data visualization (2D/3D projections)  

---

## Limitations

- Assumes linear relationships  
- Loss of interpretability after transformation  
- Sensitive to scaling of features  
- May discard useful low-variance information  

---

## Applications

- Data visualization  
- Feature extraction  
- Noise reduction  
- Image compression  
- Preprocessing for machine learning models  

---

## Evaluation Techniques

- Explained variance ratio  
- Reconstruction error  
- Visual inspection of transformed data  

---

## Practical Considerations

- Always standardize features before applying PCA  
- Use PCA before clustering (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) for better performance  
- High-dimensional data benefits significantly from PCA  
- Interpretation of transformed features can be challenging
